# PHASE 1: TECHNICAL MASTERY {#phase-1-technical-mastery}

## 1.1 Speed & Precision

### Alternate Picking Perfection

Your alternate picking should be flawless at any tempo. Practice:

```
Exercise 1: The Chromatic Burner
e|--1-2-3-4--2-3-4-5--3-4-5-6--4-5-6-7--|
B|--1-2-3-4--2-3-4-5--3-4-5-6--4-5-6-7--|
G|--1-2-3-4--2-3-4-5--3-4-5-6--4-5-6-7--|
D|--1-2-3-4--2-3-4-5--3-4-5-6--4-5-6-7--|
A|--1-2-3-4--2-3-4-5--3-4-5-6--4-5-6-7--|
E|--1-2-3-4--2-3-4-5--3-4-5-6--4-5-6-7--|

Target: Clean execution at 160+ BPM (16th notes)
```

### Economy Picking

Combine alternate and sweep picking for efficient movement:

```
Exercise 2: Three-Note-Per-String Economy
e|----------------------------------5-7-8--|
B|----------------------------5-7-8--------|
G|----------------------4-5-7--------------|
D|----------------4-5-7--------------------|
A|----------3-5-7--------------------------|
E|--3-5-7----------------------------------|

Use downstroke when moving to higher string, upstroke when moving lower.
```

### Legato Fluency

Your hammer-ons and pull-offs should be as loud as picked notes:

```
Exercise 3: Pure Legato Run
e|------------------------------------------12h15p12--|
B|-----------------------------------12h15------------|
G|---------------------------11h14--------------------|
D|---------------------11h14--------------------------|
A|---------------10h12--------------------------------|
E|--10h12h15------------------------------------------|

Only pick the first note. Everything else is legato.
```

## 1.2 Advanced Techniques

### Hybrid Picking

Use pick + fingers simultaneously for complex passages:

```
Exercise 4: Hybrid Picking Arpeggio
    p   m   a   m   (p=pick, m=middle finger, a=ring finger)
e|--------5---------5---|
B|------5---5-----5---5-|
G|----5-------5-5-------5|
D|--7-----------7-------|
A|----------------------|
E|----------------------|
```

### String Skipping

Create intervallic jumps for modern sounds:

```
Exercise 5: String Skip Pentatonic
e|--8-----------8-----------8---------|
B|-------------------------------10---|
G|------7-----------7-----------------|
D|----------7-----------7-------------|
A|-------------------------------------|
E|-------------------------------------|
```

### Tapping

Two-hand technique for extended range:

```
Exercise 6: Three-Finger Tapping
e|--12t-8p-5h-8p-12t-8p-5--|  (t=tap with right hand)
B|-------------------------|
G|-------------------------|

Exercise 7: Eight-Finger Tapping
e|--12-15-17---5-8-10----|
B|------------------------|
(Right hand: 12-15-17, Left hand: 5-8-10)
```

### Sweep Picking

Full arpeggio sweeps with no hesitation:

```
Exercise 8: Five-String Major Sweep
e|-------------12-|
B|-----------13---|
G|---------12-----|
D|-------14-------|
A|--12-14---------|
E|----------------|

Exercise 9: Minor Sweep + Tap
e|----------------12t-|
B|-----------13-------|
G|---------12---------|
D|-------14-----------|
A|--12-15-------------|
E|--------------------|
```

## 1.3 Fretboard Mastery

### Complete Neck Knowledge

You must know every note instantly:

**Exercise:** Name all instances of any note in under 5 seconds.

```
Example: Find all G notes
E|--3---------15--|
B|--------8------|
G|----0------12--|
D|------5--------|
A|--10-----------|
E|--3---------15--|
```

### Position Playing

Play any scale/mode in any position without looking:

```
The 7 Positions of C Major:
Position 1: Frets 0-4 (open position)
Position 2: Frets 2-6
Position 3: Frets 4-8
Position 4: Frets 5-9
Position 5: Frets 7-11
Position 6: Frets 9-13
Position 7: Frets 10-14

Master each position, then connect them seamlessly.
```

### CAGED System Mastery

Know all 5 shapes for every chord type:

```
Cmaj7 in all CAGED positions:
C-shape: x-3-2-0-0-0 (open)
A-shape: x-3-5-4-5-x (3rd position)
G-shape: 8-x-9-9-8-x (8th position)
E-shape: 8-10-9-9-8-8 (8th position)
D-shape: x-x-10-12-12-12 (10th position)
```

## 1.4 Timing & Rhythm

### Polyrhythmic Accuracy

Play complex rhythms against a steady pulse:

```
Exercise 10: 3 Against 4
Set metronome to quarter notes.
Play triplets while feeling the quarter notes:

Count: 1   2   3   4   | 1   2   3   4   |
Play:  x  x  x  x  x  x | x  x  x  x  x  x |
       (triplet feel)
```

### Odd Time Signatures

Master non-4/4 playing:

```
Exercise 11: 7/8 Groove
Count: 1-2-1-2-1-2-3 (2+2+3)
|: Em7 (2) | Am7 (2) | D (3) :|

Exercise 12: 5/4 Pattern
Count: 1-2-3-1-2 (3+2)
|: Cmaj7 (3) | G/B (2) :|
```

### Metric Modulation

Shift between tempos mathematically:

```
From 120 BPM quarter notes to 90 BPM:
Play dotted quarter = new quarter
(This creates a 3:4 relationship)
```

---

# PHASE 2: ADVANCED HARMONY & THEORY {#phase-2-advanced-harmony}

## 2.1 Extended Harmony

### Upper Structure Triads

Play triads over bass notes for complex sounds:

```
Over C7:
- E major triad = C7#9 sound
- Gb major triad = C7b9#11 sound  
- Bb major triad = C9 sound
- D major triad = C13 sound

Voicing Example (C7#9 using E triad over C):
e|--8--|  (E triad: E-G#-B)
B|--9--|
G|--9--|
D|-----|
A|--3--|  (C bass)
E|-----|
```

### Polychords

Stack two different chords:

```
D major over C major = Cmaj13#11
e|--2--|
B|--3--|
G|--2--|
D|--0--|
A|--3--|
E|-----|

The D triad (D-F#-A) over C creates: C-E-G-B-D-F#-A
```

### Negative Harmony

Invert harmony around an axis:

```
In C major, the axis is between E and Eb.
Mirror each note around this axis:

C → G
D → F
E → Eb
F → D
G → C
A → Bb
B → Ab

Cmaj7 (C-E-G-B) becomes Fm6 (F-Ab-C-D) in negative harmony
```

4. Finally identify extensions/alterations
5. Check your answer and repeat
```

## 4.3 Transcription Practice

### The Transcription Protocol

```
1. Listen to the full piece 3+ times (no instrument)
2. Map out the form and sections
3. Identify the key(s)
4. Transcribe the bass line first
5. Add the chord qualities
6. Transcribe the melody/solo
7. Add all nuances (bends, slides, dynamics)
8. Play along with the recording
9. Play without the recording
10. Analyze what you learned
```

### Transcription Levels

```

Level 2: Blues solos
Level 3: Jazz standards (melody + changes)
Level 4: Complex jazz solos (Charlie Parker, etc.)
Level 5: Full arrangements (bass, chords, melody, solo)
```

## 4.4 Real-Time Hearing

### Playing What You Hear

```
Exercise: Internal Singing
1. Hear a phrase in your head
2. Sing it out loud
3. Play it on guitar
4. Compare all three
5. Repeat until they match

The goal: Eliminate the gap between imagination and execution
```

```
Take a 3-5 note motif and develop it:

Original motif: E-G-A

Development techniques:
1. Sequence: E-G-A, F-A-B, G-B-C
2. Inversion: E-C-B (flip intervals)
3. Retrograde: A-G-E (backwards)
4. Augmentation: E--G--A (longer durations)
5. Diminution: EGA (shorter durations)
6. Fragmentation: E-G, G-A, E-A (use pieces)
7. Extension: E-G-A-B-D (add to it)
```

### Chord Tone Soloing

```
Over Cmaj7-Am7-Dm7-G7:

Target chord tones on strong beats:
Cmaj7: C, E, G, B
Am7: A, C, E, G
Dm7: D, F, A, C
G7: G, B, D, F

Connect them with scale tones and chromatic approaches
```

## 5.2 Rhythmic Vocabulary

### Beyond 8th Notes

```
Develop phrases in:
- Triplets
- 16th notes
- Dotted rhythms
- Syncopation
- Mixed subdivisions
- Space and rests (equally important)
```

### Displacement

```
Take a lick and start it on different beats:

Original (on beat 1):
|1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a|
|x x x x x                      |

Displaced to beat 2:
|1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a|
|        x x x x x              |

Displaced to the "and" of 1:
|1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a|
|    x x x x x                  |
```

## 5.3 Advanced Approaches

### Playing Outside

```
Techniques for creating tension:
1. Side-stepping: Play a half-step away from the key
2. Superimposition: Play a different chord's arpeggio
3. Chromatic saturation: Dense chromatic passages
4. Interval cycles: Repeat an interval through all 12 notes

Example - Side-step:
Over Cmaj7:
Play Db major pentatonic for 2 beats, resolve to C major pentatonic
```

### Resolving Outside Lines

```
The key: Always know where "home" is

Pattern:
1. Start inside (establish the key)
2. Go outside (create tension)
3. Resolve inside (release tension)

Never get lost - know exactly how far outside you are
```

## 5.4 Building a Vocabulary

### Lick Library

```
Build a collection of licks for each:
- Chord type (maj7, m7, 7, m7b5, dim7)
- Scale/mode
- Harmonic situation (ii-V, turnaround, etc.)
- Emotional character (happy, sad, tense, peaceful)

Minimum 10 licks per category
```

### Transcription Integration

```
After transcribing a solo:
1. Extract the best licks
2. Analyze why they work
3. Practice in all 12 keys
4. Use them in your own solos
5. Modify them to make them yours
```

- Raise pitch
- Crescendo

Release techniques:
- Return to tonic
- Consonant resolution
- Space and simplicity
- Lower pitch
- Decrescendo
```

## 6.2 Harmonic Writing

### Voice Leading Rules

```
1. Move each voice by the smallest interval possible
2. Avoid parallel 5ths and octaves (unless intentional)
3. Resolve tendency tones (7ths down, leading tones up)
4. Keep common tones when possible
5. Contrary motion between bass and soprano
```

### Reharmonization

```
Take a simple melody and add sophisticated harmony:

Original: Happy Birthday in C
| C | C | F | C |
| C | G7 | C | C |

Reharmonized:
| Cmaj9 | Bm7b5 E7b9 | Am9 D13 | Gmaj9 Gb7#11 |

```

## 6.3 Guitar Arrangement

### Solo Guitar Arranging

```
Elements to include:
1. Bass line (thumb or lower strings)
2. Chord voicings (middle voices)
3. Melody (top voice)
4. Fills and embellishments

Technique:
- Use open strings as drones
- Employ harmonics for color
- Chord-melody style with moving lines
```

### Arranging for Guitar in a Band

```
Consider:
1. What frequencies are other instruments covering?
2. Where can guitar fill gaps?
3. When to lead vs support?
4. Register choices (low voicings vs high voicings)
5. Rhythmic role (driving vs floating)
```

## 6.4 Creating Original Music

### Composition Methods

```
1. Melody-first: Write a memorable melody, harmonize later
2. Chord-first: Create a progression, add melody
3. Groove-first: Start with rhythm, build on it
4. Concept-first: Start with an emotion or story
5. Sound-first: Explore tones, develop from there
```

### Avoiding Clichés

```
To create original music:
1. Combine unexpected influences
2. Use unusual chord progressions
3. Explore asymmetric forms
4. Limit yourself (3 notes, 2 chords, etc.)
5. Write outside your comfort zone
```

250-500 Hz: Mud zone (careful!)
500 Hz-1 kHz: Honk and body
1-3 kHz: Presence and attack
3-6 kHz: Clarity and edge
6-10 kHz: Air and brilliance
10+ kHz: Sparkle

Rule: Cut before boosting
```

### Compression for Guitar

```
Settings starting point:
Ratio: 3:1 to 4:1
Attack: 10-30ms (let transient through)
Release: 100-200ms (match the tempo)
Threshold: -10 to -15 dB reduction

Parallel compression: Blend compressed with dry
```

## 7.4 Production Skills

# FINAL THOUGHTS

## The Path to Mastery

Becoming a truly advanced guitarist is a lifelong journey. There is no final destination—only continuous growth and deeper understanding.

### Key Principles

1. **Patience over speed**: Deep learning takes time
2. **Quality over quantity**: Perfect practice makes perfect
3. **Consistency over intensity**: Daily work beats occasional marathons
4. **Curiosity over comfort**: Growth happens at the edges
5. **Expression over technique**: Technique serves the music

### The Balance

```
Technical mastery + Musical expression + Personal voice = True artistry
```

### Remember

Every master was once a beginner. Every virtuoso has struggled. The difference is persistence, intelligent practice, and an undying love for the instrument.

Your journey is unique. Use this roadmap as a guide, but follow your musical heart.
